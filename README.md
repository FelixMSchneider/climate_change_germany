# Plot Climate data for Germany


This repository used data from german weather stations operated by DWD. Aim is to display the temperatur changes in Germany comparing the longterm mean temperatur before 1990 to the years after 1990.
I calulate yearly average temperatures and perform a linear regression from the years 1990-2022. I define Tdiff as the temperature difference between the long term mean and the 2022 value of the linear regression (see temperatur_Berlin-Tempelhof.png). 

In the map view one can see regional differences (mainly) between Western and Eastern Germany. In Eastern Germany Tdiff is alread exceeding 2Â°C. 


The corresponding data and plots were discussed by Sibylle Anderl in the german cultural journal [Kursbuch](https://kursbuch.online/montagsblock-180/)




## get data from DWD 

    mkdir data
    cd data

    wget  -r -nd --no-parent -A 'terminwert*.zip' https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/subdaily/air_temperature/historical/

    for zipfile in `ls termin*zip` 
    do 
        unzip $zipfile
    done

### create dictionary for efficient data access

    python get_temperatur_dict.py

### plot Tdiff for individual weather stations in  Germany

    cd hist_plot
    python plot_temperatur_single_stations.py

comment: this plots can be regarded as definition of Tdiff

### create histogram plot for all available weather stations in Germany

    cd hist_plot
    python plot_hist_curves.py

### create map plot (using GMT 4) to compare Tdiff 

Tdiff = averageT(before 1990) to linregT(2022)

    cd map
    bash run.sh
